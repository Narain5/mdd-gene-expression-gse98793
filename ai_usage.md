# AI Usage Documentation

## Tools Used
- ChatGPT (OpenAI, GPT-5.1)

## Purpose of AI Use
AI tools were used in a limited and supportive way. Specifically, AI helped with:
- clarifying project steps and organizing the workflow,
- improving the wording of documentation (README.md, report draft sections),
- suggesting general templates for folder structure and file organization,
- assisting with small code snippets for standard preprocessing (e.g., PCA/UMAP examples).

## What AI Did NOT Do
The core work of the project was completed manually. AI did **not**:
- run or validate any analysis,
- execute code or check dataset outputs,
- perform preprocessing, filtering, or figure generation,
- conduct any statistical analysis, differential expression, or machine learning,
- interpret results or write conclusions.

## Verification of AI Output
All code used in the project was:
- written, executed, and debugged by the student,
- tested manually in Google Colab,
- validated through inspection of summary statistics, shapes, and plots.

## Ethics & Privacy
- Only publicly available and fully anonymized GEO data (GSE98793) was used.
- No personal or identifiable human information was accessed.
- AI served only as a helper for organization and explanation, not as a scientific decision-maker.
