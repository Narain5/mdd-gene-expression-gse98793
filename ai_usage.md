# AI Usage Documentation

## Tools Used
- ChatGPT (OpenAI, GPT-5.1)

## Purpose of AI Use
AI assistance was used for:
- planning the project structure and workflow
- generating templates for README.md and ai_usage.md
- guiding GEO dataset download and preprocessing steps
- producing example code for PCA, clustering, DE analysis, and ML models
- drafting report structure (Introduction, Methods, Results outline)
- helping with GitHub file organization

## What AI Did NOT Do
- did not run or validate code
- did not access the dataset directly
- did not generate final figures or interpretations
- did not perform differential expression or ML analysis itself
- did not produce any part of the final scientific results

## Verification of AI Output
All AI-generated code is:
- tested manually in Google Colab,
- debugged and adjusted as needed,
- validated by checking shapes, summary statistics, and plots.

## Ethics & Privacy
- Only public GEO dataset GSE98793 was used.
- No identifiable human subject data was accessed.
- AI was used as a helper, not a scientific decision-maker.
