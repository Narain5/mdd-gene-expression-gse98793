# Gene Expression Analysis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)

This repository contains a complete bioinformatics workflow analyzing the GEO dataset **GSE98793**, which includes whole-blood gene expression data from **128 MDD patients** and **64 healthy controls**. The goal is to identify gene expression signatures associated with MDD and evaluate whether these signatures can separate case and control samples through exploratory analysis, dimensionality reduction, and later differential expression and machine learning.
